> Improved speed and performance.

> I developed a sample-project base on #expressjs, #restapi, #api, #nodejs, #cloudant, #ibm ,and [[cloud]], on #heroku #pipline.

> I wanted to start work on reactjs I think it has main components including grid, list, search, and connected to db. 

> I have been impressed with the mix of cloudant and reactjs! Why not! both of them are good choices for frontend and database with o/i JSON.
